Basic Snake HTML Game
README.md
Basic Snake HTML Game

Snake is a fun game to make as it doesn't require a lot of code (less than 100 lines with all comments removed). This is a basic implementation of the snake game, but it's missing a few things intentionally and they're left as further exploration for the reader.
Further Exploration

    Score
        When the snake eats an apple, the score should increase by one. Use context.fillText() to display the score to the screen
    Mobile and touchscreen support
        Allow the game to be scalled down to a phone size. See https://codepen.io/straker/pen/VazMaL
        Support touch controls
    Better apple spawning
        Currently the apple spawns in any random grid in the game, even if the snake is already on that spot. Improve it so it only spanws in empty grid locations

    Hey! Quick question, any way to change the amount of apples spawning?

    Thanks a lot!

Hey, I wanted to just say, you can make another by creating a second variable (perhaps var apple2)? and wherever you see the first apple included in the code, just duplicate it and change it to apple 2. Hope this helps =)

    how make a score btw?

(I'm not sure if this code depends on the platform you use)
I made a score like this..
div class="container"
span id="score" class="score"
0
/span
div class="words"
div class="center"
Apples eaten /div
/div
/div
(The "<" symbols made text disappear for whatever reason so just pretend the divs and spans have "<" around them)
And the JS looks like this:
var oldScore = 0; function addOldScore() {   if (score > oldScore) { oldScore = score; alert ("New high score! " +  oldScore);  //I did an alert but you can make a custom score } else { //Whatever you want when their score didn't beat their old score }  } var resetScore = function() { score = 0; renderScore(); } var score = 0; var scoreElement = document.querySelector( '.score' ); var addPoint = function() { score++; renderScore(); } var renderScore = function() { scoreElement.innerHTML = score; } 
And in this if statement(if (cell.x === snake.cells[i].x && cell.y === snake.cells[i].y )), add this:
addOldScore(); resetScore();
Let me know if there are any issues =)

    how to control its speed
    // slow game loop to 15 fps instead of 60 (60/15 = 4)
    if (++count < 4) {
    return;
    }
    increases this value 4(8)

It should have arrow key controls already, the code is there. Just use up, down, left, right

How can i change that to everytime when the snake ates a apple it's spawns a new delayed and i don't want the delay. How can i fix that?

    How do I set it to tell the player if it win or lose

So In the code there’s a function (this one): `if (cell.x === snake.cells[i].x && cell.y === snake.cells[i].y) {
snake.x = 160;
snake.y = 160;
snake.cells = [];
snake.maxCells = 4;
snake.dx = grid;
snake.dy = 0;

    apple.x = getRandomInt(0, 25) * grid;
    apple.y = getRandomInt(0, 25) * grid;
  } `

So after snake.dy = 0; the game is restarting so you can put anything after that line to make it show the player won or lost. I suggest making a div that is blank from the start and then the game restart function makes the div equal to a specific text such as you died. To make a you won screen you would have to implement a few more things depending on what you consider as winning. Let me know if you need any more help

So the picture is what it’s supposed to look like, so you are on the right track. Can you let me know what Software your using to place the code in? That way I know how to better assist you, and you can also check my previous comments and replies as I have answered similar questions before. Let me know =]

you set key down arrows

triggered on key down not on key press

there is key down code

left = 37
up = 38
right = 39
down = 40

keep this values and you set this trigger code

This was one of my first games written by me. Now I write much more complex games, including gambling. Recently I read about online casinos in Alberta, for me this is a new level. I want to create a poker game for the phone in the near future. It will take a lot of time, because I am still working, but it is possible to write code little by little.
